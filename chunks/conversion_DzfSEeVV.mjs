These are the rules for C3:\n\n- `float` to `int` conversions require a cast.\n- `int` to `float` conversions *do not* require a cast.\n- `bool` to `float` converts to `0.0` or `1.0`\n- Widening `float` conversions are only conditionally allowed<sup>*</sup>.\n- Narrowing conversions require a cast<sup>*</sup>.\n- Widening `int` conversions are only conditionally allowed<sup>*</sup>.\n- Signed <-> unsigned conversions of the same type *do not* require a cast.\n- In conditionals `float` to `bool` *do not* require a cast, any non zero `float` value considered true.\n- Implicit conversion to `bool` only occurs in conditionals or when the value is enclosed in `()` e.g. `bool x = (1.0)` or `if (1.0) { ... }`\n\nC3 uses two's complement arithmetic for all integer math.\n\n:::note \nThese abbreviations are used in the text below:\n- \"lhs\" meaning \"left hand side\".\n- \"rhs\" meaning \"right hand side\".\n:::\n\n### Target type\n\nThe left hand side of an assignment, or the parameter type in a call is known as the *target type* the target type is used for implicit widening and inferring struct initialization.\n\n### Common arithmetic promotion\n\nLike C, C3 uses implicit arithmetic promotion of integer and floating point variables before arithmetic operations:\n\n1. For any floating point type with a bitwidth smaller than 32 bits, widen to `float`. E.g. `f16 -> float`\n2. For an integer type smaller than the *minimum arithmetic width* promote the value to a same signed integer of the *minimum arithmetic width* (this usually corresponds to a c int/uint). E.g. `ushort -> uint`\n\n### Implicit narrowing\n\nAn expression with an integer type, may implicitly narrow to smaller integer type, and similarly a float type may implicitly narrow to less wide floating point type is determined from the following algorithm.\n\n1. Shifts and assign look at the lhs expression.\n2. `++`, `--`, `~`, `-`, `!!`, `!` - check the inner type.\n3. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `|`, `&`, `??`, `?:` - check both lhs and rhs.\n4. Narrowing `int`/`float` cast, assume the type is the narrowed type.\n5. Widening `int`/`float` cast, look at the inner expression, ignoring the cast.\n6. In the case of any other cast, assume it is opaque and the type is that of the cast.\n7. In the case of an integer literal, instead of looking at the type, check that the integer would fit the type to narrow to.\n8. For `.len` access, allow narrowing to C int width.\n9. For all other expressions, check against the size of the type.\n\nAs rough guide: if all the sub expressions originally are small enough it's ok to implicitly convert the result.\n\nExamples:\n```c3\nfloat16 h = 12.0;\nfloat f = 13.0;\ndouble d = 22.0;\n\nchar x = 1;\nshort y = -3;\nint z = 0xFFFFF;\nulong w = -0xFFFFFFF;\n\nx = x + x; // => calculated as x = (char)((int)x + (int)x);\nx = y + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed as y > char\nh = x * h; // => calculated as h = (float16)((float)x * (float)h);\nh = f + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed since f > f16\n```\n\n### Implicit widening\n\nUnlike C, implicit widening will only happen on \"simple expressions\":\nif the expression is a primary expression, or a unary operation on a primary expression.\n\nFor assignment, special rules hold. For an assignment to a binary expression, *if* its two subexpressions are \"simple expressions\" and the binary expression is `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, allow an implicit promotion of the two sub expressions.\n\n```c3\nint a = ...\nshort b = ...\nchar c = ...\nlong d = a; // Valid - simple expression.\nint e = (int)(d + (a + b)); // Error\nint f = (int)(d + ~b); // Valid\nlong g = a + b; // Valid\n```\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if there are more than one possible conversion an explicit cast is needed.\n\nExample:\n\n```c3\nlong h = a + (b + c);\n\n// Possible intention 1\nlong h = (long)(a + (b + c));\n\n// Possible intention 2\nlong h = (long)a + (long)(b + c);\n\n// Possible intention 3\nlong h = (long)a + ((long)b + (long)c);\n```\n\n### Maximum type\n\nThe *maximum type* is a concept used when unifying two or more types. The algorithm follows:\n\n1. First perform implicit promotion.\n2. If both types are the same, the maximum type is this type. \n3. If one type is a floating point type, and the other is an integer type, \nthe maximum type is the floating point type. E.g. `int + float -> float`.\n4. If both types are floating point types, the maximum type is the widest floating point type. E.g. `float + double -> double`.\n5. If both types are integer types with the same signedness, the \nmaximum type is the widest integer type of the two. E.g. `uint + ulong -> ulong`.\n6. If both types are integer types with different signedness, the \nmaximum type is a signed integer with the same bit width as the maximum integer type. `ulong + int -> long`\n7. If at least one side is a struct or a pointer to a struct with an \n`inline` directive on a member, check recursively check if the type of \nthe inline member can be used to find a maximum type (see below under sub struct conversions)\n8. All other cases are errors.\n \n### Substruct conversions\n\nSubstructs may be used in place of its parent structs in many cases. The rule is as follows:\n\n1. A substruct pointer may implicitly convert to a parent struct.\n2. A substruct *value* may be implicitly assigned to a variable with the parent struct type, \nThis will *truncate* the value, copying only the parent part of the substruct. However, a \nsubstruct value cannot be assigned its parent struct.\n3. Substruct slices and arrays *can not* be cast (implicitly or explicitly) to an array of the parent struct type.\n\n### Pointer conversions\n\nPointer conversion between types usually need explicit casts. \nThe exception is `void*` which any type may implicitly convert *to* or *from*. \nConversion rules from and to arrays are detailed under [arrays](/language-common/arrays/)\n\n### Vector conversions\n\nConversion between underlying vector types need explicit conversions. They work\nas regular conversions with one notable exception: converting a `true` boolean\nvector value into an int will yield a value with all bits set. So `bool[<2>] { true, false }`\nconverted to for example `char[<2>]` will yield `{ 255, 0 }`.\n\nVectors can also be cast to the corresponding array type, for example: `char[<2>]` <=> `char[2]`.\n\n## Binary conversions\n\n#### 1. Multiplication, division, remainder, subtraction / addition with both operands being numbers\n\nThese operations are only valid for integer and float types.\n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. Find the [maximum type](#maximum-type) of the two operands.\n3. Promote both operands to the resulting type if both are simple expressions\n4. The resulting type of the expression is the [maximum type](#maximum-type).\n\n#### 2. Addition with left side being a pointer\n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. If the rhs is not an integer, this is an error.   \n3. If the rhs has a bit width that exceeds isz, this is an error.\n4. The result of the expression is the lhs type.\n\n#### 3. Subtraction with lhs pointer and rhs integer \n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. If the right hand type has a bit width that exceeds isz, this is an error.\n3. The result of the expression is the left hand type.\n\n#### 4. Subtraction with both sides pointers\n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. If the either side is a `void*`, it is cast to the other type.\n3. If the types of the sides are different, this is an error.   \n4. The result of the expression is isz.\n5. If this result exceeds the target width, this is an error.\n\n#### 6. Bit operations `^` `&` `|`\n\nThese operations are only valid for integers and booleans.\n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. Find the [maximum type](#maximum-type) of the two operands.\n3. Promote both operands to the [maximum type](#maximum-type) if they are simple expressions.\n4. The result of the expression is the [maximum type](#maximum-type).\n\n#### 6. Shift operations `<<` `>>` \n\nThese operations are only valid for integers.\n\n1. Resolve the operands.\n2. In safe mode, insert a trap to ensure that rhs >= 0 and rhs < bit width of the left hand side.\n3. The result of the expression is the lhs type.\n\n#### 7. Assignment operations `+=` `-=` `*=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `^=` `|=` `&=`\n\n1. Resolve the lhs.\n2. Resolve the right operand as an assignment rhs.\n3. The result of the expression is the lhs type.\n\n#### 8. Assignment shift `>>=` `<<=`\n\n1. Resolve both operands\n2. In safe mode, insert a trap to ensure that rhs >= 0 and rhs < bit width of the left hand side.\n3. The result of the expression is the lhs type.\n\n#### 9. `&&` and `||`\n\n1. Resolve both operands.\n2. Insert bool cast of both operands.\n3. The type is bool.\n\n#### 10. `<=` `==` `>=` `!=`\n\n1. Resolve the operands, left to right.\n2. Find the [maximum type](#maximum-type) of the two operands.\n3. Promote both operands to the [maximum type](#maximum-type).\n4. The type is bool.\n\n## Unary conversions\n\n#### 1. Bit negate\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. If the inner type is not an integer this is an error.   \n2. The type is the inner type.\n\n#### 2. Boolean not\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. The type is bool.\n\n#### 3. Negation\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. If the type inner type is not a number this is an error.\n3. If the inner type is an unsigned integer, cast it to the same signed type.\n4. The type is the type of the result from (3)\n\n#### 4. `&` and `&&`\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. The type is a pointer to the type of the inner operand.\n\n#### 5. `*`\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. If the operand is not a pointer, or is a `void* ` pointer, this is an error.\n3. The type is the pointee of the inner operand's type.\n\nDereferencing 0 is implementation defined.\n\n#### 6. `++` and `--`\n\n1. Resolve the inner operand.\n2. If the type is not a number, this is an error.\n3. The type is the same as the inner operand.\n\n## Base expressions\n\n#### 1. Typed identifiers\n\n1. The type is that of the declaration.\n2. If the width of the type is less than that of the target type, widen to the target type.\n3. If the width of the type is greater than that of the target type, it is an error.\n\n#### 2. Constants and literals\n\n1. If the constant is an integer, it is assumed to be the *arithmetic promotion width* and signed. \nIf the suffix `u` is added, it is assumed to be an unsigned number. If a suffix `ixx` or `uxx` \nis given then it is considered a an integer of that type width and signedness. It cannot be implicitly narrowed. \n2. If the constant is a floating point value, it is assumed to be a `double` unless suffixed\n with `f` which is then assumed to be a `float`. If a bit width is given after `f`, \n it is instead a floating point type of that width.\n";
