This means that anyone using it in production would need to stay\n updated with the latest fixes.\n\nThe focus of `0.7`â€“`0.9` will be fleshing out the cross-platform standard \nlibrary and make sure the syntax and semantics are solid. Also, the \ntoolchain will expand and improve. [Please refer to this issue for what's \nleft in terms of features for `1.0`](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/1456).\n\n\nThe intended roadmap has one major `0.1` release per year:\n| Date       |  Release  |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 2025-04-01 |    0.7    |\n| 2026-04-01 |    0.8    |\n| 2027-04-01 |    0.9    |\n| 2028-04-01 |    1.0    |\n\n### Compatibility\n\nMinor releases in the same major release series are compatible. \n\nFor example `0.6.0`, `0.6.1`, ... `0.6.x` are compatible and `0.7.0`, `0.7.1`, ... `0.7.x` are compatible.\n\n\n### Standard library\nThe standard library is less mature than the compiler. It needs more \nfunctionality and more tests. The compiler reaching a `1.0` release only \nmeans a language freeze, the standard library will continue to evolve \npast the `1.0` release.";
