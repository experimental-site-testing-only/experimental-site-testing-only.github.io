[File an issue for the website](https://github.com/c3lang/c3-web/issues/new)\n\n### ðŸ’ª Contribute\n\nNow the compiler is stable, what is needed now are the *non-essentials*, such as a docs generator, editor plugins, LSP etc.\n\n- [A list of what's needed is on Github](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/1456).\n- [Help on the compiler](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c).\n- [Help on the docs](https://github.com/c3lang/c3-web).\n";
