For more information check the [init command reference](/build-your-project/build-commands/#init-a-new-project).\n\n### 📁 Project structure\n\nIf you check the directory that was created you might find it a bit confusing with a bunch of different directories, but worry not because if you expand them you will realise that most of them are actually empty!\n\n<FileTree>\n- build/\n- docs/\n- lib/\n- resources/\n- scripts/\n- src/\n  - main.c3\n- test/\n- LICENSE\n- project.json\n- README.md\n</FileTree>\n\n#### Directory Overview\n| Directory       | Usage         |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| `./build`       | Where your temporary files and build results will go. |\n| `./docs`        | Code Documentation |\n| `./lib`         | C3 libraries (with the .c3l suffix) |\n| `./resources`   | Non-code resources like images, sound effects etc. |\n| `./scripts`     | Scripts, including .c3 scripts that generate code at compile time. |\n| `./src`         | Storing our code, by default contains `main.c3` with \"Hello World\". |\n| `project.json`  | Record project information, similar to `package.json` in NodeJS. |\n| `LICENSE`       | Project license. |\n| `README.md`     | Help others understand and use your code. | \n\n### 🔧 Building the project\n\nAssuming you have successfully initialized a project as seen above, we can now look at how to compile it.\n\n#### 🏃 Build & run\n\nC3 has a simple command to build & run our project.\n\n```bash {4}\nc3c run\n> Program linked to executable 'build/myc3project'.\n> Launching ./build/myc3project...\n> Hello, World\n```\n\nYou can also specify the target to build & run.\n```bash\nc3c run myc3project\n```\n#### 🔧 Build\n\nIf you only want to build the project, you can use the `build` command:\n\n```bash \nc3c build\n```\n\nThis command builds the project targets defined in our `project.json` file.\n\n:::note\nIf you want to build a specific target, you can do so by specifying its name.\nThe default target is created with the name of the project, such as `myc3project`.\n\n```bash \nc3c build myc3project\n```\n:::\n\nWe will now have a binary in `build`, which we can run:\n\n```bash\n./build/myc3project\n```\n\nIt should print `Hello, World!` and return back to the command line prompt. \nIf you are on Windows, you will have `myc3project.exe` instead. Call it in the same way.\n\n\nIf you need more detail later on check [C3 project build commands](/build-your-project/build-commands/) and [C3 project configuration](/build-your-project/project-config/) to learn more.\n";
